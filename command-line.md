If I were to liken using the command line to driving a car, it would be the driver's seat console. A car won't know what you want it to do unless you offer very deliberate actions; in the same way, to explain the Command line, I'll break it down in very specific segments. For instance, if I want to shift the car out of Park and into Drive, the instructions must be detailed for the computer to understand. To parallel the "git push" feature in the Command line, I'd first:
    1. Reach for (or navigate to) the gear shifter
    2. Grasp (or select) the shifter and indicate what gear to shift into
    3. Push (or, well, push!) the gear into it's next action. 

    Ten commands that I'm familiar with now are as follows:
    1. cp = copy
    2. mkdir = make a new directory
    3. rmdir = remove directory
    4. mv = move directory or file
    5. cd = change directory
    6. cd .. = move back one branch in the directory
    7. Touch = creates a new file
    8. pwd = print working directory, or show the current file branch path
    9. cd ~ = navigates to the base of the tree/home folder
    10. - p = creates the series of folders during mkdir rather than making them one at a time.
